Documentation:
========
This module, numpyIO, is an implementation in python of the c version of
SciPy's numpyio by Travis Oliphant. The advantage of using numpyIO is the ease
of installation: numpyIO depends only on numpy and does not need scipy.

Initial benchmarking with 10000000 samples indicates that numpyIO is about 5%
faster than SciPy's numpyio module.

Only 2 functions were implemented: fread and fwrite.

The interfaces of the 2 functions here are exactly the same as those of
numpyio. If you have code using numpyio, you don't have to change anything to
call fread and fwrite, except changing numpyio to numpyIO.

=======
Roadmap:
=======
Scipy's "IO Roadmap" on http://projects.scipy.org/scipy/scipy/roadmap says:

Reworking of IO package

The IO code in both NumPy and SciPy is undergoing a major reworking. NumPy
will be where basic code for reading and writing NumPy arrays is located,
while SciPy will house file readers and writers for various data formats
(data, audio, video, images, matlab, excel, etc.). This reworking started
NumPy 1.1.0 and will take place over many release. SciPy 0.7.0 has several
changes including:

Several functions in scipy.io have been deprecated and will be removed in the
0.8.0 release including npfile, save, load, create_module, create_shelf,
objload, objsave, fopen, read_array, write_array, fread, fwrite, bswap,
packbits, unpackbits, and convert_objectarray. Some of these functions have
been replaced by NumPy's raw reading and writing capabilities, memory-mapping
capabilities, or array methods. Others have been moved from SciPy to NumPy,
since basic array reading and writing capability is now handled by NumPy.

History:
=======
2009-01-03: Read the roadmap and realized that I probably should be using 
            np.fromfile/tofile or np.memmap ... rewrote using to/fromfile
            and now it is often *faster* than SciPy's numpyio.
2009-01-01: Happy with refactored implementation and complete tests (ACB).
2008-12-30: Cleanup and port to numpy 1.3.0 (ACB).
2005-09-02: Added a few new read_types to support Matlab R14 mat-files. Not
            comprehensive.
2003-03-31: Coded and tested.
